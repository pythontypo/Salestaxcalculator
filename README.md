# Salestaxcalculator
This program is designed to help a cashier to calculate the sales tax and total price of a product. This program also calculates the change if a customer paid with cash. The program gives the exact number of bills and coins of each denomination. The program excludes $2.00 bill, $1.00 coin, and $0.50 coin since these are rare.
